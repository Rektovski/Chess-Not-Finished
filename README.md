# Chess

This code is simple and non finished version of chess.
I used here two-dimensional arrays to create border, board, to implement figure into the matrix.

At this moment code check next errors:

1. // Error 0 - Same color figures attacks each other.
2. // Error 1 - Color
3. // Error 2 - Figure's name
4. // Error 3 - Coordinate Error
5. // Error 4 - Empty starting coordinate
6. //  Error 5 - starting figure
7. // Error 6 - Movement Rule
8. //  Error 7 - Check and Mate


At this moment I have somekind of error about check. I don't know why but it works everytime. Sometimes figures can move legally but systems says that this is illegal moves.
